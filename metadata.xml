[h3]Amp[/h3]
Starts with two red hearts, slightly above average speed, and lower than normal damage. Theyâ€™ve got electrified tears that can really pack a punch against swarms of enemies, and they have so much electricity built up in them that even just being near things will electrocute them!

[h3]Tainted Amp[/h3]
[i]Amp's lost soul, doomed to forever roam the basement.[/i]
Starts with 3 soul hearts, as well as flight and spectral, but even lower damage, but they come with with Technology Zero as a third tear modifier!
